# Near-Far Interactor

Interactor that utilizes both near and far interaction casters, allowing seamless transitions between different
interaction types, while also using the far interaction caster's data to interact with UGUI.

This interactor is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing advanced developers to implement custom near and far casters that adhere to the `IInteractionCaster` and `ICurveInteractionCaster` interfaces, respectively.

The `IInteractionAttachController` interface allows developers to implement custom attach controllers that can be used to control the attach transform for translation and rotation.
The default implementation for this enables distance-based velocity scaling on motion to pull objects to the user from afar, with hand tracking and controller tracking support.

To complement this interactor, a visual controller component called `CurveVisualController` leverages the `ICurveInteractionDataProvider` interface to provide all the data required of the curve in a streamlined interface to allow for a flexible visual representation of the curve.

This interactor is designed to integrate the functionality of both `XRDirectInteractor` and `XRRayInteractor`, though there are two notable gaps to keep in mind.
- For mobile AR devices, the ray interactor is still required for raycasting AR data, as this `NearFarInteractor` does not yet support this use case.
- The `NearFarInteractor` does not yet support using the joystick to control the attach transform for translation, rotation and scaling, as the `XRRayInteractor` does.

## Enums

### Region

Used by the `selectionRegion` property to indicate whether the selection is currently occurring in the near-field or far-field region.

- **None**: No selection is occurring.
- **Near**: Selection is occurring with near-field interaction.
- **Far**: Selection is occurring with far-field interaction.

### NearCasterSortingStrategy

Determines the strategy for sorting valid targets discovered by the near interaction caster.

- **None**: No sorting is performed.
- **SquareDistance**: Sorting based on the square distance between the interactor and interactable attach transform world positions. Most efficient.
- **InteractableBased**: Sorting based on the interactable's defined sorting strategy, usually collider based.
- **ClosestPointOnCollider**: Sorting based on the square distance between the interactor's attach transform world position and the closest point on the interactable's collider. Used for high fidelity disambiguation.

### InteractorFarAttachMode

Controls the interactor's default behavior for how to adjust its attach transform on far select.

- **Near**: The interactor should reset its attach transform to the near point on far select. This will typically result in the interactable object moving to the hand.
- **Far**: The interactor should always move its attach transform to the far hit point on far select. This will typically result in the interactable object staying distant at the far hit point.

This behavior may be overridden by interactables, such as XR Grab Interactable, which implement the `IFarAttachProvider` interface. Those interactables default to using the interactor's preferred value, but the interactables can choose to force either Near or Far when selected as a result of being hit by the far interaction caster.

## Usage

This component should be attached to a GameObject that acts as an interactor in an interaction system. It requires components implementing `IInteractionAttachController`, `IInteractionCaster` for near casting, and `ICurveInteractionCaster` for far casting for full functionality. Default components implementing those interfaces will automatically be added at runtime if the Interaction Attach Controller, Near Caster, or Far Caster references are missing.
