  "description": "A high-level, component-based, interaction system for creating VR and AR experiences. It provides a framework that makes 3D and UI interactions available from Unity input events. The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components, and an Interaction Manager that ties these two types of components together. It also contains components that you can use for locomotion and drawing visuals.",

    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue where pinching with the Hand Interaction Profile caused the Interactables to stick to the thumb longer than desired, moving the object after a pinch was released. The `ReleaseThresholdButtonReader` sample component was updated with new default values to ensure tighter press and release when pinching. ([XRIT-334](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-334)) (Backport from 3.3.0)\n- Fixed hand prefabs in the `Hands Interaction Demo` sample that were based on the hand models from the XR Hands `HandVisualizer` sample. The new prefabs are built as a prefab variant, allowing smoother upgrade when the underlying models are updated. (Backport from 3.4.0-pre.1)\n- Fixed an issue with the `JumpProvider` continually being stuck in the `LocomotionState.Moving` state and never entering the `LocomotionState.Ended` state. (Backport from 3.4.0-pre.1)"
