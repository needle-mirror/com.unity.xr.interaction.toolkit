  "description": "A high-level, component-based, interaction system for creating VR and AR experiences. It provides a framework that makes 3D and UI interactions available from Unity input events. The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components, and an Interaction Manager that ties these two types of components together. It also contains components that you can use for locomotion and drawing visuals.",

    "changelog": "### Changed\n- Changed `BaseTeleportationInteractable` and `ClimbInteractable` `Awake` logic to limit expensive `FindObjectOfType` search for `TeleportationProvider` and `ClimbProvider` to once per frame if those `LocomotionProviders` are left null in the inspector. (Backport from 3.0.4)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed Teleportation Area component so it filters out Sphere Cast overlap hits at the start of the sweep so it no longer teleports to (0, 0, 0). Changed so the selection is blocked so the XR Interactor Line Visual uses its blocked style in that case. ([XRIT-138](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-138)) (Backport from 3.0.5)\n- Fixed Sector interaction Editor to draw all properties in the Input Actions Editor window in Unity 2022.3 or newer. (Backport from 3.0.5)\n- Fixed regression with `XRSocketInteractor` and `XRSocketGrabTransformer` where an interactable GameObject does not move to the position of the `XRSocketInteractor` when set as the Starting Selected Interactable. ([XRIT-164](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-164)) (Backport from 3.0.5)"
